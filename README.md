# AutoEncoder_MNIST_Fashion
A basic example of an Autoenconder to visualize the concept.
In the past decade Image retrieval is the advancing Field of research in the computer vision domain. Apart from the CNNs, the Autoencoders 
plays a significant role for such retrieval systems. Autoencoder is a Neural Network and also an unsupervised Learning Algorithm. 
It applies Backpropogation algorithm by settiing the same input as  the target value.
