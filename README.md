# AutoEncoder_MNIST_Fashion
A basic example of an Autoenconder to visualize the concept.
In the past decade Image retrieval is the advancing Field of research in the computer vision domain. Apart from the CNNs, the Autoencoders 
plays a significant role for such retrieval systems. Autoencoder is a Neural Network and also an unsupervised Learning Algorithm. 
It applies Backpropogation algorithm by settiing the same input as  the target value.

# Installation and running
Install Tensorflow for GPU machine
```
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```
If you don't have a GPU
```
pip install tensorflow
```
Download the MNIST Fashion Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist

Put the proper path of the dataset, and type
```
python autoencoder.py
```
Now, training will start, and at the end you can observe the output generated by the decoder, which will be similar to the input image provided.

Once you have trained it, you can visualize the output of the decoder and compare it with the original image. Here in the figure below, left image is the original, and one in the right is created by reshaping the output vector of size 784 into 28x28. Well! now one can use the encoder part as a pretrained network.
